                        <p class="artist__bio">akka is an experimental artist, radio producer, DJ and community facilitator interested in the sonic, written word and collective organising; guided by a framework of anti-racism, radical hope and reciprocity. Creating under the pseudonym akka, she fuses voice memos, found-sounds, echoic compositions, and influences of her mixed-multifaith lineage. She uses soundscaping as a means to unhinge linear expectations of colonial form and knowledge - in the pursuit of divinity and connection.</p>

              <p>We hope you can find all you need to know for now here, but for anything else please get in touch via hello@soma-festival.com. A detailed info pack will be shared closer to the event.</p>
              </br>
              <h3>Accessibility <span>+</span></h3>
              <div class="visually-hidden">
                <p>We are committed to creating a safe and inclusive festival experience for all staff, artists and attendees. Details are available below, but if you would like more information, or for any accessibility requirements please get in touch via hello@soma-festival.com so we can do our best to support you.</p>
                </br>
                <p>A site map will be provided via this info section closer to the event date and will detail where everything is located on-site, including access and accessible facilities.</p>
                </br>
                <p><u>Access around the site:</u> Soma is located on a private farm property. The event perimeter from the carpark to the main event area is generally flat, but is a greenfield area with some slight mounds and dips which can be affected by wet weather, so please take this into consideration when planning your visit. The site is unfortunately not wheelchair accessible.</p>
                </br>
                <p>We will have a designated parking area for those that require parking closer to the campground and main event area. Please speak with staff upon entry should you require this, and they will direct you. </p>             
                </br>                
                <!-- <p><u>Accessible toilets:</u> We will have accessible gender-neutral restroom facilities available on site. The exact location will be shown on the site map when available.</p>
                </br>-->
                <p><u>Lighting & effects:</u> Due to the nature of the event, strobe lighting, lasers and smoke machines will be used at times throughout the course of the event. There will be spaces away from the main stage area without the use of these effects, including a quieter, undercover breakout space.</p>
              </div>
              <h3 class="alternate">Accomodation <span>+</span></h3>
              <div class="visually-hidden">
                <p>Soma is an on-site camping event, with plenty of space to pitch a tent and create a home for the weekend. There will also be a dedicated space for van camping.</p>
                </br>
                <p>There will be no pass outs available.</p>

They also set out the express basis of your entry to the event, which includes an indemnity and release in favour of the organisers. You should read these terms and conditions carefully.</p>
        <p>The terms and conditions of this agreement shall constitute a contract between Soma Music & Arts Pty Ltd (“Promoter”) and the individual holding a ticket (“Ticket Holder(s)”) in relation to the event known as “Soma” taking place in NSW in November 2024 (referred to as “the Event”). Any valid ticket purchased or given to a Ticket Holder in respect of the Event and a Ticket Holder’s entry to the Event and presence at the Event site (including the surrounding camping grounds and any other areas designated by the Promoter as part of the Event) is subject to the following terms and conditions: </p>    

        <ol>
          <p class="terms-heading"><u>Ticketing and Refunds</u></p>
          <li>The Promoter will make decisions pursuant to this condition in good faith and attempt to notify Ticket Holders of any decisions regarding these matters. Notwithstanding, the Promoter retains the absolute discretion without limitation, to decide on these matters without notice or explanation to Ticket Holders. If the Promoter exercises any of these rights, no refund or compensation will be available to Ticket Holders.</li>
          <li>If you do not receive a confirmation email after submitting payment information, or if you experience an error message or service interruption after submitting payment information, it is your responsibility to confirm with the Soma Team whether or not your order was successful. </li>
          <li>All ticket sales are final and binding. The Promoter will not be required to refund any ticket purchases. Tickets are non transferable and are not for resale and unlawful resale is grounds for seizure or cancellation of tickets. If a Ticket Holder is unable to attend the Event, it can only be resold through our resale facility via Humanitix. Tickets cannot be resold at a premium. If a ticket is sold or offered for resale at a premium over the original purchase price including handling costs, then the Promoter reserves the right to cancel the re-sold ticket without refund and without notice to both the original and new Ticket Holder and the bearer of the ticket may be refused admission to the Event. </li>
          <li>Entry to and attendance at the Event is only permitted to Ticket Holders who agree to these terms and conditions and the Event rules displayed on site and communicated by the Promoter in any other formats, including any reasonable directions issued by the Promoter or on behalf of the Promoter by Event staff (Festival Rules).</li>
