      <h3>SOMA FESTIVAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
      <p>
        The terms and conditions of entry into Soma Festival are set out below.
        They contain important information about the event. They also set out
        the express basis of your entry to the event, which includes an
        indemnity and release in favour of the organisers. You should read these
        terms and conditions carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terms and conditions of this agreement shall constitute a contract
        between Soma Music & Arts Pty Ltd (“Promoter”) and the individual
        holding a ticket (“Ticket Holder(s)”) in relation to the event known as
        “Soma” taking place in NSW in November 2024 (referred to as “the
        Event”). Any valid ticket purchased or given to a Ticket Holder in
        respect of the Event and a Ticket Holder’s entry to the Event and
        presence at the Event site (including the surrounding camping grounds
        and any other areas designated by the Promoter as part of the Event) is
        subject to the following terms and conditions:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <p class="terms-heading"><u>Ticketing and Refunds</u></p>
        <li>
          The Promoter will make decisions pursuant to this condition in good
          faith and attempt to notify Ticket Holders of any decisions regarding
          these matters. Notwithstanding, the Promoter retains the absolute
          discretion without limitation, to decide on these matters without
          notice or explanation to Ticket Holders. If the Promoter exercises any
          of these rights, no refund or compensation will be available to Ticket
          Holders.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you do not receive a confirmation email after submitting payment
          information, or if you experience an error message or service
          interruption after submitting payment information, it is your
          responsibility to confirm with the Soma Team whether or not your order
          was successful.
        </li>
        <li>
          All ticket sales are final and binding. The Promoter will not be
          required to refund any ticket purchases. Tickets are non transferable
          and are not for resale and unlawful resale is grounds for seizure or
          cancellation of tickets. If a Ticket Holder is unable to attend the
          Event, it can only be resold through our resale facility via
          Humanitix. Tickets cannot be resold at a premium. If a ticket is sold
          or offered for resale at a premium over the original purchase price
          including handling costs, then the Promoter reserves the right to
          cancel the re-sold ticket without refund and without notice to both
          the original and new Ticket Holder and the bearer of the ticket may be
          refused admission to the Event.
        </li>
        <li>
          Entry to and attendance at the Event is only permitted to Ticket
          Holders who agree to these terms and conditions and the Event rules
          displayed on site and communicated by the Promoter in any other
          formats, including any reasonable directions issued by the Promoter or
          on behalf of the Promoter by Event staff (Festival Rules).
        </li>
        <li>
          The Promoter reserves the right to refuse entry to or evict any person
          from the Event who does not comply with the terms and conditions
          and/or Festival Rules and/or is involved in an illegal activity and/or
          is responsible for any behaviour which is deemed by or on behalf of
          the Promoter to be anti-social or dangerous. If a Ticket Holder is
          refused entry to or evicted from the Event pursuant to this paragraph,
          no refunds will be issued to the Ticket Holder on any unused portion
          of the Ticket Holder’s ticket.
        </li>
        <li>
          Soma is an over 18s event. Ticket Holders must show official proof of
          age photo identification in order to gain entry into the Event and at
          any other time when requested to by Event staff. No refund will be
          issued to any Ticket Holder who is refused entry to or evicted from
          the Event because of lack of or failure to produce valid proof of age
          photo identification. No ID. No entry.
        </li>
        <li>
          Entry to the Event will be granted with presentation of a ticket. The
          Promoter takes no responsibility for the sale of fraudulent or copied
          versions of tickets to the Event by third parties that may preclude
          the entry of a ticket holder. Tickets must be presented at the gate.
          Failure to produce a ticket in order to gain entry into the Event will
          result in refusal of entry into the Event. When the ticket is
          presented to Event staff upon entry, the tickets will be exchanged for
          Event wristbands that must be worn by the Ticket Holder for the
          duration of the Event. The Promoter and Event staff reserve the right
          to evict anyone from the Event who is not wearing a valid Event
          wristband. Anyone found onsite at the Event without a valid wristband,
          will be deemed to have trespassed, be removed from the Venue, and may
          be handed over to the Police. Maximum penalties apply.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is a condition of purchase that the Ticket Holder consents to the
          Promoter collecting and retaining their personal information. The
          Promoter will hold your information as required by the Privacy Act
          1988 (Cth) and will contact you in relation to ticketing matters and
          Event information.

          containers for searching as directed. If a Ticket Holder does not
